# TODO

* Use directories for indexes when building to serve locally, but keys when
  building for S3.
* Test for the majority of functions in build's main.go.
* Download images found in fragment frontmatter.
* Smarter asset symlinking that doesn't remove and create every time.
* Remove orphaned files between builds.
* Speed up the build (maybe incremental?).
