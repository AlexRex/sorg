Hi everyone, here's to hoping that the ongoing normal life grinding to a halt thing hasn't been too catastrophic.

A side effect of my brave new commute-free bar-free travel-free life is over the last couple weeks I've found myself with more free time than ever before in my adult life. Some of it's been used well (daily runs, morning and evening calisthenics, touched a guitar for the first time in months), some of it not-so-well, and some of it in the middle.

One of those middle activities are video games. Although we're seeing some change in attitude towards it over the last few years, traditionally, society has classified gaming as the favored hobby of social misfits and basement dwellers. And not without reason as it does have its dark elements -- especially some multiplayer games and MMOs are capable of eating practically every moment of an enthusiastic person's existence, loot boxes were seemingly developed as a perfect regulatory loophole letting kids gamble, micro transactions to maximize profiteering, and infamously hostile online cultures.

But enjoyed the right way, video games are some of the most beautiful media produced by humanity today. Graphics are so good that they're capable of transporting players to vibrant alien worlds of impossible vistas and unspeakable wonder. Stories are more detailed and expansive than their counterparts in film or TV because there's more opportunity to explore. Writing and acting in top games might fall a little short of the very best that Hollywood has to offer, but if so ... not by much.

I'm as much of a fan of a great TV series or movies as the next person, but I often come away from that sort of passive consumption experiences feeling like a vegetable. Best case scenario, I viewed something complicated and cerebral with rapt attention throughout. More often, (like [the vast majority](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/88-of-americans-use-a-second-screen-while-watching-tv-why/) of the world these days) I'm watching at about half attention, with the other half on a second screen like a laptop or smartphone. But with a video game there's no choice except to be 100% engaged, and often in a way that's stimulating the mind -- even outside of puzzle games, you're trying to optimize an equipment load out, understand a skill system, or decode a boss' attack patterns to finally defeat them.

---

Over the years, I've adopted a certain discipline to time spent on games with the goal of maximizing enjoyment and minimizing waste. I only play the top rated games on any particular systems -- less time wasted on bad ones, and even a handful of games are good for 100s of hours of entertainment. I don't play multiplayer -- the gameplay dynamics required to create a working online ecosystem make grinding (playing long hours to build skill or generate in-game resources) an inherent properties, and the trade off's not worth it for me. I'm a casual gamer through and through -- thrown into a _DOOM_ deathmatch, I'd be put to rest by your run-of-the-mill six year old. I'm okay with that.

With that out of the way, here's a couple game recommendations from the last couple years. As usual, skip ahead a few sections to go straight to more technical content.

## A most wholesome dystopia (#wholesome-dystopia)

[_Horizon Zero Dawn_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Zero_Dawn) (also pictured at the top) is easily one my favorite games of all time. You play as Aloy, a young huntress brought up as an outsider a tribe of hunter-gatherers. The greater world is a dangerous place as it's overrun by robot dinosaurs. As wacky as that sounds -- it works. They make some of the most compelling antagonists in any video game ever, and as Aloy makes her way through the world, puzzle pieces start falling into place, and a plausible story for how the world ended up like this emerges.

![Horizon Zero Dawn -- Aloy looking out on the Aurora Borealis](/assets/images/nanoglyphs/012-virtual-worlds/horizon-zero-dawn-night-3@2x.jpg)

The combat is some of the best ever developed for a console [1]. It centers around a bow and arrow, and it turns out that mechanics of a slight delay in drawing, aiming for (destructible) weak spots on your opponents combined with a subtle bullet time effect strikes a perfect compromise between challenge, satisfaction, and fun.

The writing, voice acting, and graphics are all top notch. Careful design was even applied to the UI so that little tasks like healing or crafting ammunition aren't slow or annoying. Moving around the world is so much fun that I found myself completing every side quest with no prompting.

If you make it that far, the end of the story is sublime, heartfelt, and beautiful.

## A heartfelt father-son story, with trolls (#father-son)

I held off playing the PS4 headliner [_God of War_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)) for a long time because I assumed it wasn't really my thing. A guy with an axe with a little kid following him around the whole time? Sounds annoying. Well, I finally picked it up this year, and boy, was I wrong.

![God of War -- Alfheim](/assets/images/nanoglyphs/012-virtual-worlds/god-of-war-1@2x.jpg)

Previous entries in the _God of War_ franchise are based around Greek mythology, but this one takes a hard left turn by placing Kratos in the realm of Midgard [2], surrounded by Norse gods and other mythical figures instead of their Greek counterparts. The story purposely leaves some unexplained plot between itself and previous games and starts with Kratos and his (new) young son coming to terms with the recent death of his mother. They set out on a journey to fulfill her last wish -- that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the nine realms.

Like _Horizon Zero Dawn_, the game's combat focuses on many successive fights of relatively few challenging enemies at any given time. It starts with the basics of light and heavy attacks, parry, and dodge, but takes on limitless depth with the addition of countless new skills throughout. Kratos' primary weapon is the Leviathan Axe, which (in a nod to Thor's hammer Mjölnir) has the power to return to his hand after he throws it. The solid feeling of the axe's heavy blows landing through the controller is one of the most masterfully designed weapon experiences in gaming's history.

_(Warning: Continued aggressive use of superlatives to follow.)_ The game's world is gorgeous. The post-game material, including the grinding needed to get the very best armor and items, is shockingly fun to the point where you stop noticing you're even doing it. The voice acting is absolutely superb -- Christopher Judge (Teal'c from _Stargate_) as Kratos is possibly the most perfect actor/character fit in the history of recorded audio, and listening to Mímir [3] tell old norse myths as you paddle around the world is filler that transcends itself. Its technical excellence is impressive too -- graphics are legitimately breathtaking, and there are no loading screens throughout the entire game (although some tricks are employed to delay the player until new areas are ready).

To reiterate a thought from above, I'm blown away by just how well a great video game stands up to _any_ other type of media including our greatest film and literature. Good ones are masterworks of technical and artistic perfection, and these are two great examples.

## Another World (#another-world)

Fabien Sanglard, author of the Game Engine Black Book series has written a great series of articles starting with [_The Polygons of Another World_](https://fabiensanglard.net/another_world_polygons/index.html). Although nominally about the 1991 game, it's really more of a case study of the architecture of a whole line of computers and consoles from Amiga to Jaguar. The first article starts with background, then each subsequent examines the architecture, quirks, and game implementation on each system including schematics, color palettes, and screenshots.

_Another World_ is particularly good as a case study because over the years it's been ported to so much different hardware. Fabien's series covers seven systems from the 80s and 90s, and since then it hasn't even stopped, with 2020 releases on PS4, Xbox One, and Switch. Its 2D polygons were also well-suited to graphical tricks that let it run on surprisingly underpowered hardware — it was released in '91, but supported the Amiga A500 released almost five years earlier in '87.

A few highlights:

* It on the [A500](http://fabiensanglard.net/another_world_polygons_amiga500/index.html) largely thanks to its “blitter” [4], a dedicated co-processor that performed data transfer in parallel with the CPU. The blitter could be used to quickly fill polygons and draw their borders with a specialized “draw line mode”, acting like an early GPU.
* The [Atari ST](http://fabiensanglard.net/another_world_polygons_atariST/index.html) eventually featured a bitter as well, but too late in its lifecycle for many games to make use of it. _Another World_ renders entirely in software on the ST's Motorola 68k processor. This is only made possible thanks to _Another World_’s style of wide single-color cells — most of the frame could be drawn quickly in 16 pixel blocks, with finer edges drawn with slower per-pixel operations (see the screenshot below — the red sections are the precision sections that need to be drawn).

![Another World polygon shapes](/assets/images/nanoglyphs/012-virtual-worlds/lester-masked.png)

* A challenge of porting to the [IBM PC](http://fabiensanglard.net/another_world_polygons_PC_DOS/index.html) was the variety of hardware that might be under the hood. The game had to ship with two sets of color palettes — one to support the modest 6-bit TGA/EGA color standards, and another for the newer 18-bit VGA.
* The [SNES](http://fabiensanglard.net/another_world_polygons_SNES/index.html) was designed to accommodate developers with flexible needs and reserved part of its bus address space to support a custom chip _inside the cartridge itself_ (how cool is that?). Another World bundled a modest one to keep per-unit costs down (SlowROM), but by storing a scanline of polygon data there, it was able to boost performance 10% and hit its target framerate.
* For the [Game Boy Advance](http://fabiensanglard.net/another_world_polygons_GBA/index.html), which sported an ARM7 chip, the entirety of the original game’s incompatible 68k assembly was ported back to C, then re-optimized.
* With so much extra available power on the [Atari Jaguar](http://fabiensanglard.net/another_world_polygons_Jaguar/index.html), its _Another World_ port runs through a specialized JIT compiler that optimizes the game to make use of the system’s graphics hardware. It makes use of remastered 1152x720 256 color backgrounds, making the game’s look a far shot from the original.

Something that looking at old screenshots of _Another World_ reminded me of is just how far video games have come just in my lifetime. We've gone from being able to draw just a handful of two-dimensional polygons on the screen with painstaking care and perseverance to fully realized worlds with graphics more reminiscent of reality than not, lifelike characters, and detailed interactive narratives that put the linear storylines of even our greatest works of linear fiction to shame. Imagine what the next 30 years will hold.

## Cell chips and tempest engines (#cell-chips)

Speaking of, we've recently been indulged with details on what the next generation of console hardware is going to look like. The [technical specifics](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-playstation-5-specs-and-tech-that-deliver-sonys-next-gen-vision) of the PS5 were supposed to be revealed in a developer-facing talk at GDC this year, but after it was postponed, Sony streamed them alternative instead.

Next gen gaming console hardware is itself a game, in marketing. This might most infamously embodied by the PS3's Cell architecture, which before release was hailed as so groundbreaking that it would change gaming forever. It featured one powerful primary core (a "PPE", or power processor element), but an incredible _eight_ secondary cores (SPEs, or "synergistic" processing elements). The dream was that games would be massively parallelized, with one core doing the heavy lifting and secondary functions farmed out to SPEs to be assembled into a unified experience firing on all cylinders. Unfortunately, developers found it difficult and time consuming to make that work in practice, especially compared to the Xbox 360's simpler model of three big, symmetrical 3.2 GHz cores. Later titles like _The Last of Us_ were finally able to make good use of Cell, but it underdelivered for years, especially for multi-platform titles.

But I give Sony's marketing people a pass on the embellishment because _it feels good_ to be excited about hardware again. Computation in the PC market has become enough of a commodity that we're far more likely to be interested in things like form factor and battery life these days. Consoles are one of the last places where hardware is being built to push the envelope in performance because the coming generation of titles will be fully expected to make use of it.

The PS5 won't have anything quite so exotic as Cell. Both it and the Xbox Series X will make use of AMD's Zen 2 architecture -- the same one used in Ryzen and Threadripper PC chips (which by all accounts are blowing Intel out of the water on every measurable metric), with the PS5 running 8x cores at 3.5 GHz.

PC gamers will be amused to know that the biggest performance gains compared to the last generation are expected to stem from the fact that PS5 will finally have an SSD, making them late to the game by only a decade or so. But to be fair, this SSD will be a _monster_, with off-the-charts performance at 5.5 GB/s and 8-9 GB/s in practice as hardware-level decompression is used to move then decode data stored as zlib or the even more performant [Kraken](http://www.radgametools.com/oodlewhatsnew.htm). Given how impressive the loading times were on the PS4 and its spinning disks, the PS5 should be extraordinary (based on Sony's numbers, the increase in I/O throughput from the hard disk compared to the PS4 is on the order of 100x).

The PS5's most quixotic feature is the Tempest Engine, a dedicated compute unit designed to usher in a new era of audio fidelity. The example they used was that while rainfall in games today is a uniform prerecorded sound, the Tempest Engine will aim to model the unique character of every individual droplet as it lands and echoes back to a player's ear. Another Cell chip in the making? Very possibly. We'll find out soon enough.

## Bullet time (#bullets)

[This article](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TristanJung/20191206/355250/How_Do_Bullets_Work_in_Video_Games.php) does a great job of describing the implementation of bullets in 3D games. Nothing hugely surprising, but an aspect that's not necessarily obvious is that games will use different techniques depending on the effect they're trying to achieve and the weapons they're trying to model. 

Simple, fast weapons as seen in something like _Call of Duty_ might use a "hitscan" to figure out where a bullet should go based on a player's location and the direction they're facing. A more complex weapon like a rocket launcher will model projectiles as full 3D entities with their own mass, velocity, and hitbox.

On a less technical front, [this is a great character piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/magazine/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-video-game.html) on Hideo Kojima from the NYT.

![Kojima from the NYT](/assets/images/nanoglyphs/012-virtual-worlds/kojima@2x.jpg)

I've never been a huge fan of his games, even if I respect his work. When I was in high school I went to a friend's house so that he could show me the epic hour-long plus cinematic sequence at the end of _Metal Gear Solid 2_. I made it ten minutes before literally falling asleep. Most reviews of _Death Stranding_ read like reference letters written by hostages for their captors after being trapped in [a Stockholm bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norrmalmstorg_robbery) with them for a week ("not many of what you'd call _traditional_ values, slightly misguided, but has _a lot of heart_").

That said, I love the cult of Kojima. It's powerful, and hard to explain:

> Kojima proceeded to play perhaps the strangest three and a half minutes of video ever to grace the E3 stage. Keep in mind that this is a venue where cybernetic dinosaurs and giant-felling samurai are par for the course. The video opened with a William Blake poem, the first lines of “Auguries of Innocence,” then cut to a close-up of highly realistic computer-generated sand. The camera floated over the sand, revealing a jumble of dead crabs. Handprints appeared in the sand and then filled up, inexplicably, with black goop. The handprints led to a naked man lying on the beach, his left wrist locked in glowing handcuffs. A black cord connected the man to what appeared to be a tiny infant, lying next to him on the sand. The man rose to his hands and knees and crawled over to the baby and picked it up and cradled it in his hands, bringing it to his chest, and his face was revealed and it was ... Norman Reedus from “The Walking Dead”? And he was weeping hysterically?
> 
> There was no hint as to the story, the gameplay or even the genre of the game. It was all mood and symbol and Norman Reedus’s shiny posterior. It was more like something you’d see at MoMA than at E3. **But the crowd went wild.**

In the first _Metal Gear Solid_, Psycho Mantis breaks the fourth wall to demonstrate his psychokinetic powers by physically moving your controller (its built-in rumble pack might have some hand in it too). _Metal Gear Solid 3_ features a sequence where you do nothing but climb a ladder for an excruciating long two real-world minutes. _Death Stranding_ is a Fedex simulator with a minor social network bolted on. If there's one person out there who's pushed the envelope on creativity to the point where it's resting against a backdrop of sheer weird, it's this guy, and it's hard not to admire that.

There's something deeply engrained in the nature of the human condition that predisposes us to having heroes. It's natural, even healthy. You could do much worse than Kojima.

TODO

[1] Shooting arrows in _Horizon Zero Dawn_ is some of the best combat across any system, but might be edged out ever so slightly by a truly great FPS played on PC with a mouse and keyboard. e.g. _Half-life 2_.

[2] Midgard is the name for Earth in old Germanic cosmology. The realm inhabited by humanity as opposed to Asgard, inhabited by the gods, or Jotunheim, the land of giants.

[3] Mímir, best known for his well of knowledge, to which Odin sacrificed his eye in pursuit of wisdom.

[4] The name “blitter” comes from the “bit blit” operation of the Xerox Alto, which stands for bit-block transfer.
