We held our annual Stripe internal conference last week, with our out of town employees all converging on San Francisco for the largest simultaneous gathering all year. Like this year, the first of these I went to years ago was held at the Palace of the Fine Arts, an event space over near the Marina. But while in that first year we occupied only a tiny corner of the building, this year the massive event space felt positively crowded — quite a turnaround.

Most of the event was BigCo troop rallying of the kind you might expect, but I was pleasantly surprised by the external talks that’d been lined up, including one from Jonathan Blow.
