+++

A few months ago I rebooted my dormant enthusiasm in making my own sushi, and bought a fancy kitchen knife to go with the hobby — 52 layers of hammered Japanese steel and fashioned in the style of an [ancient Damascus blade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_steel), it’s a work of art — functional, and all pleasing aesthetic lines.

As anyone’s who owned of these can attest, a knife like this isn’t a one-time transaction. You buy it once, and maintain it forever. Always use a cutting board. It’s not stainless steel, so don’t leave it wet. Sharpen it regularly. To help with that last point, I bought an honest-to-goodness whetstone (a nice product of the commodity age, only $30 on Amazon) and learned to use it via the globe’s most preeminent tutor, YouTube. Submerge for 10 minutes to let it absorb water, sharpen on the coarse grit, flip the stone, sharpen on the fine one. A little laborious, but satisfying.

A single sharpening session yields some immediate benefit, but the real key is engage in them _regularly_. That way, everything you do with your tools stays more fluid and more efficient. Intense, periodic investments for small, frequent yields over a long time.
