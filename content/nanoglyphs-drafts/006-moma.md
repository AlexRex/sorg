It’s been a catastrophic week of weather in the Bay: almost-kind-of rain. The cloud cover never goes away, and most of the time it feels like it might be so presumptuous as to start to drizzle. A few times it’s even gone as far as to rain for a little while. Californians everywhere are afraid and confused. Winter jackets, toques, and umbrellas are a common sight on the street. A true catastrophic event for a part of the world with absurdly temperate weather.

It was an indoor type weekend, so I visited San Francisco’s MOMA. It’s always an interesting place. The exhibit I visited for was a display of space-faring art from the golden age of space 70s space optimism (TODO: check). It was okay, but given the quality and quantity of the source material, it could have been much more comprehensive.

Many of the exhibits at the MOMA fit the stereotype of modern art perfectly: simple geometric shapes and art pieces made up of a single solid colour. One protip for visitors who aren’t committed to a full ticket: so far it’s held true that the best piece of art at the MOMA is free to see.

There’s a large format exhibit available free to the public through the entrance off Natoma St. These days, it’s the huge moving display of the people of San Francisco pictured above. Maybe the closest thing to a _Daily Prophet_ you can get in real life.
