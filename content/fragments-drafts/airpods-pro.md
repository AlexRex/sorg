I've previously written about the first generation of [AirPods](/fragments/airpods), which I consider Apple's best product release in years. I skewed all the way from not planning to buy them to using them in a huge variety of day-to-day situations from cooking to running.

As good as they were, the original AirPods had two major deficiencies:

* **Sound isolation:** Or total lack thereof. It made them unusable in any loud environment like work, public transit, or city streets.

* **Tap interface:** The "tap" interface to play/pause and change tracks didn't work well. It was awkward to trigger and unreliable. I tried it once and never used it again.

Well, Apple's knocked it out of the park a second time. I've had the AirPods Pro for just under a week, and am already comfortable calling them the best earphones I've ever owned because they're _so_ much better than any other. They have all the advantages of the old AirPods (including the wireless charging case, fast pairing, and automatic pairing with all iCloud devices introduced in the second generation), and fix all their problems.

## Quiet, finally (#quiet)

The active noise cancellation (ANC) is unbelievable. I audibly gasped the first time I turned it on, and like magic, the noise made by our office's HVAC system disappeared. I rode home on Muni, experimentally disabled it, and the transition felt like a punch to the face. The noise produced by San Francisco's trams is normally hard to appreciate because your brain is so good at adapting to it, but when contrasting it to the relative quiet allowed by ANC, you realize just how embarrassingly loud this medieval system really is. Same goes for BART. I've had some old Bose headphones kicking around for a few years but was never particularly impressed with them; Apple's ANC feels better by full multiples.

## Tapped out (#tapped)

Taps have been replaced by presses. Once for play/pause, twice for forward, and three times for backwards. A long press to toggle between ANC and "transparency" mode (which lets in outside sound). Unlike the taps, it feels good and is quite functional.

## Flatter, better (#flatter)

At first the Pros' fit into their charging case feels a little more awkward than the originals because the big silicon buds can't provide as perfect of a fit, but you quickly get used to it. The subtle magnetic suction is still there. The charge light is improved -- tap the case while it's on a charge mat and it'll show amber for charging and green for charged. The case is a little bigger than the last generation, but it feels about the same.

With the non-Pro AirPods I always kept a pair of wired earphones with good sound insulation close at hand for use in environments that weren't perfectly quiet. The Pros will end that practice, with the only advantage of wired at this point being battery life in cases where you want to listen for really extended periods. These may be the perfect earphones -- another welcome home run from Apple.
