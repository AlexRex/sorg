My first 24 hours in Lisbon -- my internal clock is so wildly askew that that I wake up around 4 AM and have trouble getting back to sleep.

Trying to make the best of a bad situation, I unpack my camera, and start walking down the hill towards the center of the city. Here we see the entrance to Lisbon's famous **Rua Augusta**, a wide pedestrian avenue and one of the most beautiful streets in the city.

If you walk further along it in the direction of the ocean, you'll arrive at the [Rua Augusta Arch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rua_Augusta_Arch). Already impressive, it's made even more so by the history it was built to commemorate. In 1755, the city was flattened by [a monster of an earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1755_Lisbon_earthquake) in the 8.5-9 range, still one of the deadliest in human history. The colossal arch symbolizes reconstruction as one of the world's greatest cities was reborn from its own ashes.\
