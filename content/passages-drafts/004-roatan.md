hello

## Roatan (#roatan)

I had a bit of a Grand Budapest hotel experience (“quote TODO”), which up until then, was something that I didn’t think happened in real life. It was low season, and aside from me, the hotel and grounds were almost empty. I’d show up in the morning for dive expeditions, and I’d be the sole passenger in the sole boat that went out for the day (out of a diving fleet of ~9 ships). That’s a great recipe for seeing marine life (the divemaster has little else to do except look for things), and also kind of weird — I’d stand there as helpless as an infant as the boat’s crew did all my equipment assembly and suited me up.

With Yelp not-a-thing and few other people around to telegraph good restaurants through business, I found places to eat the _really_ old-fashioned way — word of mouth, and by walking around town peering into patios and looking at menus. I haven’t had a restaurant discovery experience like that in over ten years — sometimes you got a good one, sometimes you didn’t, but it was all mechanically satisfying in a similar sense to making pour-over coffee or reading a paperback.

Walking infrastructure was typically central American (very bad), but it was a pleasant surprise to find that it was possible to walk the length of the beach from the West End (where I was staying — the slightly grungy, more down-to-earth part of the island) to the West Bay (a series of more traditional higher end resorts) ending upon reaching the cliffs overlooking the Grand Roatan at the end of the beach. Ten kilometers round trip. Only a few rocks to climb over. Highly recommended.

## Hunting lionfish (#lionfish)

<TODO: lionfish picture>

In a way, the lionfish is a strikingly beautiful species. But when it comes to their presence in most of the world, they’re one of the most formidable and harmful invasive species imaginable — native to the Indo-Pacific, they’ve been making steady progress taking over the west Atlantic, Caribbean, and Mediterranean seas. Venomous spines make them an incredibly effective predator — so much so that a single lionfish on a reef has been observed to [reduce juvenile fish populations by as much as 79%](https://today.oregonstate.edu/archives/2010/apr/lionfish-invasion-continuing-expand).

To help control their population many governments have blessed divers to hunt them. Given that for most of my dives my divemasters’ only charge was me, they’d often take advantage of that. Lionfish hunting technology is (1) shockingly low-tech, and (2) unbelievably effective: a short three-pronged spear attached to an elastic band. Underwater, the hunter pulls the spear back along the length of the elastic, aims, and POW, invader skewered. My divemasters’ would carry pliers in their BCD to get started on trimming a catch’s spines immediately, and then find something interesting to feed it to, like a moray eel.

A fact that surprised me is that even in their home region, the lionfish have astonishingly few predators. A number of larger animals are known to prey on them, but not consistently. It’s speculated that animals that feed on juvenile lionfish and larvae may be one of the key factors in controlling their home populations, but who or what does that is still poorly understood. That fact, combined with the problem that diver control efforts are limited to human-frequently depths, make the prospect of population control difficult.

## The triclops (#triclops)

I picked up an iPhone 11 on its first day of available about 14 hours being flying out, so for a time at least I can probably came to have had the only one in Honduras. It’s largely the same as the iPhone X launched two years ago, with the notable exception of the new camera system.

Wideangle feels right

TODO: Sea at night.

I like the camera so much that I was carrying just my phone, I felt far less FOMO not having a real camera system with me. I say that pretty much every time I get a new phone, but it _is_ more true with every year. We’ve long since passed the point where most people’s phone is their camera, but more hobbyist photographers who tend to invest in more traditional equipment are going to be attriting to just smartphones too (and maybe even me …).
