hello

## Roatan (#roatan)

I had a bit of a _Grand Budapest Hotel_ experience [1], which up until then, was something that I didn’t think happened in real life. It was low season, and aside from me, the hotel and grounds were almost empty. I’d show up in the morning for dive expeditions, and I’d be the sole passenger in the sole boat that went out for the day (out of a fleet of ~nine. A great recipe for seeing marine life (divemasters have little else to do except keep an eye out), and also weird in some ways — with no one else to pay attention to, our boat's deck hand would assemble every piece of my equipment, proceed to put that equipment _onto me_, and then led me over the side of the boat like a show pony. Convenient, but in the way that being a doted on five-year old is convenient.

The area's marine is impressive. Eagle rays were the signature macro life, one hitting about seven feet wide, and with its long tail trailing behind it. We saw sea turtles on almost every dive, the biggest a full meter in length. I saw my first [mantis shrimp][xkcd], and amazed by the clacks of its snapping claws that were fully audible underwater despite the animal being about four centimeters long (TODO: explain). Aside from those: seahorses, nudibranchs, neck crab, morays.

I got into a comfortable routine: wake up early. Eat. Dive. Wait 20 minutes. Dive again. Rinse equipment. Finish with the ocean by 11 o'clock. Read in hammock or go look around the island.

### Island living (#island-living)

With Yelp not-a-thing and few other people around to telegraph good restaurants through business, I found places to eat the _really_ old-fashioned way — word of mouth, and walking around town peering into patios and looking at menus. Sometimes you got a good one; often you didn’t; but it was mechanically satisfying in the same way as making pour-over coffee or reading a paperback.

Walking infrastructure was typically Central American (bad), but it was a pleasant surprise to find that it was possible to walk the length of the beach from the West End (where I was staying — a slightly grungy, more down-to-earth part of the island -- think San Francisco's Mission district) to the West Bay (a series of more traditional higher end resorts) ending upon reaching the cliffs overlooking the Grand Roatan at the end of the beach. Just follow the coast, duck under the volleyball net when you get there, and when you hit a series of rocks that look semi-impassable, climb over them regardless. Ten kilometers round trip. Highly recommended.

### Hunting invaders (#lionfish)

<TODO: lionfish picture>

In a way, the lionfish is a striking beauty, but, when it comes to their presence in most of the world, they’re one of the most formidable and harmful invasive species ever known. Native to the Indo-Pacific, in recent decades they’ve been making steady progress taking over the west Atlantic, Caribbean, and Mediterranean. Venomous spines make them a near perfect predator — so much so that a _single_ lionfish on a reef has been observed to [reduce juvenile fish populations by as much as 79%](https://today.oregonstate.edu/archives/2010/apr/lionfish-invasion-continuing-expand).

To help control their numbers, many governments have blessed divers with special hunting rights. Given that for most of my dives my divemasters’ only charge was me, they’d often take advantage of them. The state of the art in lionfish hunting technology is a short three-pronged spear attached to an elastic band. Shocking primitive, and as it turns out, even more shockingly effective. The hunter pulls the spear back along the length of the elastic, aims, and ***POW*** -- invader skewered. I never saw a miss. My divemasters’ carried a rusty pair of pliers in their BCDs and got started on trimming a catch’s spines immediately. We'd then find something interesting to feed it to, like a moray eel, unless it was a particularly large catch -- those were specially earmarked for grilling.

Even in their home part of the world, lionfish have astonishingly few predators. Some larger animals (e.g. morays, groupers, sharks) are known to prey on them, but not consistently. It’s speculated that animals that feed on juvenile lionfish and larvae may be one of the key factors in controlling home populations, but who or what does that job is still poorly understood. That fact, combined with the problem that diver control efforts are limited to shallow, human-frequented depths, make the prospect of meaningful population control difficult.

## The triclops (#triclops)

I picked up an iPhone 11 on its first day of available about 14 hours before my flight, so for a time I can probably claim to have had the only one in Honduras. It’s largely the same as the iPhone X launched two years ago, with the notable exception of the new camera system.

Apple has introduced a new 0.5x wide angle lens to make the phone's visual array a triplet. At first glance I assumed it was a gimmick, but I was wrong. After deploying the phone's camera for a few days, I realized that 0.5x was more often than not the field of view that I wanted. Like any wide angle lens it distorts things, but it lets you capture a field of view that gives the viewer a much better feeling of what it's like to actually be there.

![Sunset over the Seagrape](/assets/images/passages/004-roatan/sunset@2x.jpg)

I like the camera so much that when I was carrying just my phone, I didn't feel the normal FOMO of not having a real camera system with me. People say that with every new iPhone release, but it really is more true with every one. We’ve long since passed the point where most people’s phone is their camera, but more hobbyist photographers who tend to invest in more traditional equipment are going to be attriting to just smartphones too. That will likely eventually include yours truly -- notably, every photo in this edition was taken on an iPhone.
