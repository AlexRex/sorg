Many of us in technology-adjacent circles have been
grumbling for years about the continued centralization of
the web. The overwhelming trend has been for content to
gravitate towards the internet's Great Walled Gardens --
Facebook, YouTube, Medium, and the like. As time marches
on, not only are those gardens getting bigger, but their
walls are growing higher, with the idea of interoperability
fading to a relic of a more idealistic past.

It's not clear what it'll take to break the walls back
down, and we're not likely to bring back the pioneering
culture of the 90s & 2000s, but a core prerequisite to
renewed decentralization is the continued production of
independent content. A fond memory of the earlier days of
the internet was the experimentation -- people building new
projects and making new things in every medium from writing
to Photoshop to interactive Flash [1], and it falls to
those of us who care to keep trying to build, design, and
create.

In that spirit: I'm about to fly to Berlin, and am running
a tiny photography and writing project called
***Sequences*** while I'm there. The format is a photograph
every day, accompanied by a few words that I'll try to keep
interesting. Think of it like an isolate, self-hosted, Ye
Olden Days version of Instagram. No likes, no comments, no
react-ji -- just a channel from me to the open web in the
hopes that I can show you some cool stuff.

I'm publishing everything via <a href="/sequences.atom" class="feed-icon">feed</a> (which will be empty for the next few days). For those that fell off the RSS wagon after the implosion of Google Reader, I'll also be <a href="https://twitter.com/brandur" class="twitter-icon">tweeting</a> new photos.
